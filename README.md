# AgentFlow

AgentFlow is a Python orchestrator for `codex`, `claude`, and `kimi` agents with Airflow-style DAGs, parallel scheduling, multiple execution targets, and a live web console for traces and artifacts.

## Features

- Airflow-like pipeline definitions in Python and YAML
- Parallel DAG execution with dependency-aware scheduling
- Per-node selection of model, provider, tools policy, MCP servers, and skills
- Execution targets for local processes, containers, and AWS Lambda
- Per-node output capture as either final response or full trace
- Post-run success criteria including output contains text, file exists, file contains text, and file non-empty
- Run queueing, retries, retry backoff, cancellation, rerun, and persisted run recovery
- Web UI for DAG state, attempt history, JSONL trace parsing, stdout/stderr, and node artifacts
- Redacted per-node `launch.json` artifacts for debugging shell bootstrap, container wrapping, and Lambda payloads
- API endpoints for validation, launch, events, artifacts, cancel, rerun, and health checks

## Why this shape

This project was built in this repo, and the integrations were informed by:

- OpenAI Codex CLI patterns in `reference/codex`
- Claude Code web and stream patterns in `reference/claude-code-telegram`
- Moonshot Kimi CLI protocol and UI patterns in `reference/kimi-cli`

Those references shaped the trace parsers, adapter contracts, and frontend event model.

## Install

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Quick start

Validate a pipeline:

```bash
agentflow validate examples/pipeline.yaml
```

Inspect the resolved launch plan before running it:

```bash
agentflow inspect examples/local-real-agents-kimi-smoke.yaml
agentflow inspect examples/local-real-agents-kimi-smoke.yaml --output json-summary
agentflow inspect examples/pipeline.yaml --node review --output json
```

The default summary view now includes resolved per-node model, tools, capture, skills, MCP server names, and provider details when they are set, which makes it easier to verify mixed Codex, Claude, and Kimi launch configs before you execute a run.
For local nodes, it also surfaces shell bootstrap details such as `shell`, login and interactive flags, and `shell_init`, so Kimi-backed wrappers are easier to confirm without decoding the full launch command.
It also shows whether `agentflow run` or `agentflow smoke` will trigger the local doctor preflight automatically in the default `auto` mode, which helps you confirm bundled-smoke and Kimi-bootstrap detection before you launch anything.
When that auto preflight is enabled because of a local Kimi bootstrap, the inspect output now also names the matching nodes and whether the trigger came from `target.shell_init` or `target.shell`, so it is easier to trust why the guard rail will run.
Use `--output json-summary` when you want the same compact information in a machine-readable format without the full prepared env and payload details from `--output json`.

Run a pipeline once:

```bash
agentflow run examples/pipeline.yaml
```

When you use `agentflow run` with the bundled real-agent smoke file, an explicit reference to that bundled file, or a custom local pipeline that clearly bootstraps Codex or Claude through `kimi`, AgentFlow now runs the same local preflight as `agentflow smoke` by default. Use `--preflight never` when you intentionally want to bypass those readiness checks.

Inspect how a pipeline will resolve prompts, shell bootstrap, and launch commands without executing any agents:

```bash
agentflow inspect examples/local-real-agents-kimi-smoke.yaml
```

Run the bundled real-agent smoke check:

```bash
agentflow smoke
```

The bundled smoke now launches both `codex` and `claude` inside `bash -lic` so login-shell startup files are exercised for local CLI installs. Both nodes also run `kimi` first, which keeps the default smoke aligned with shared Kimi bootstrap setups where the same shell helper prepares both CLIs.

By default, `agentflow smoke` now prints a compact per-node summary instead of the full run record JSON. Use `agentflow smoke --output json-summary` when you want a compact machine-readable payload for scripts, or `agentflow smoke --output json` when you want the complete persisted run record with stdout, stderr, and trace details.

The bundled smoke preflight now matches that output mode too, so warning and failure reports stay in summary form by default and switch to JSON when you pass `--output json`.
When those preflight checks detect a bash login startup bridge problem, the same smoke or run command now includes the ready-to-paste shell bridge recommendation inline instead of making you rerun Doctor separately.
In the default `auto` mode, AgentFlow runs that preflight for the bundled smoke path, for explicit references to the bundled smoke file, and for custom local smoke pipelines that clearly bootstrap Codex or Claude through `kimi` in their local shell target. `agentflow run` now uses the same guard rails for those same pipeline shapes. Use `--preflight always` to force the same checks for other custom smoke pipelines, or `--preflight never` when you need to skip them.

Check the local Codex/Claude/Kimi smoke prerequisites without launching a run:

```bash
agentflow doctor
```

`agentflow doctor` prints JSON by default so CI and wrapper scripts can parse it directly. Use `agentflow doctor --output summary` when you want a quick human-readable checklist instead.
Add `--shell-bridge` when you want Doctor to include a ready-to-paste login-shell bridge snippet for `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, or `~/.profile`.

Run the web console:

```bash
agentflow serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Runtime configuration

You can configure the runtime via CLI flags or environment variables.

- `AGENTFLOW_RUNS_DIR`: base directory for run state and artifacts
- `AGENTFLOW_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`: maximum number of concurrently executing DAG runs

CLI equivalents:

```bash
agentflow serve --runs-dir .agentflow/runs --max-concurrent-runs 2
agentflow run examples/pipeline.yaml --runs-dir .agentflow/runs --max-concurrent-runs 2
agentflow run examples/pipeline.yaml --output summary
agentflow run examples/pipeline.yaml --output json-summary
```

## Airflow-like Python DAG

```python
from agentflow import DAG, claude, codex, kimi

with DAG("demo", working_dir=".", concurrency=3) as dag:
    plan = codex(task_id="plan", prompt="Inspect the repo and plan the work.")
    implement = claude(
        task_id="implement",
        prompt="Implement the plan:\n\n{{ nodes.plan.output }}",
        tools="read_write",
    )
    review = kimi(
        task_id="review",
        prompt="Review the plan:\n\n{{ nodes.plan.output }}",
        capture="trace",
    )
    merge = codex(
        task_id="merge",
        prompt="Merge the implementation and review outputs.",
    )

    plan >> [implement, review]
    [implement, review] >> merge

spec = dag.to_spec()
```

See `examples/airflow_like.py` for a complete runnable example.

## Pipeline schema

Each node supports:

- `agent`: `codex`, `claude`, or `kimi`
- `model`: any model string understood by the backend
- `provider`: a string or a structured provider config with `base_url`, `api_key_env`, headers, and env
- `tools`: `read_only` or `read_write`
- `mcps`: a list of MCP server definitions
- `skills`: a list of local skill paths or names
- `target`: `local`, `container`, or `aws_lambda`
- local working-dir and shell bootstrap fields: `cwd`, `shell`, `shell_login`, `shell_interactive`, and `shell_init`
- `capture`: `final` or `trace`
- `retries` and `retry_backoff_seconds`
- `success_criteria`: output or filesystem checks evaluated after execution

Top-level pipeline controls include:

- `concurrency`: max parallel nodes within a run
- `fail_fast`: skip downstream work after the first failed node

Runtime numeric settings are validated up front: `concurrency` must be at least `1`, `timeout_seconds` must be greater than `0`, and both `retries` and `retry_backoff_seconds` must be non-negative.

MCP definitions are also validated before launch: `stdio` servers require `command` and reject HTTP-only fields such as `url`, `streamable_http` servers require `url` and reject stdio-only fields such as `command`, and MCP server names must be unique within a node.

Built-in provider shorthands:

- `codex`: `openai`
- `claude`: `anthropic`, `kimi`
- `kimi`: `kimi`, `moonshot`, `moonshot-ai`

`provider: kimi` is intentionally rejected on `codex` nodes. Codex requires an OpenAI Responses API backend, and Kimi's public endpoints do not expose `/responses`.

## Execution targets

### Local

Runs the prepared agent command directly on the host. Set `target.shell` to wrap the command in a specific shell, such as `bash -lc`. If you provide a shell name without an explicit command flag, AgentFlow uses `-c` by default; opt into startup file loading with `shell_login: true` and `shell_interactive: true`. You can also use a `{command}` placeholder in the shell string to run shell bootstrap steps before the prepared agent command.

That default `-c` behavior applies to `{command}` templates too, so wrappers such as `env FOO=bar bash {command}` work without needing to spell `-c` manually.

`target.cwd` controls the local node working directory. Absolute paths are used as-is; relative paths are resolved from the pipeline `working_dir`. File-based success criteria such as `file_exists`, `file_contains`, and `file_nonempty` are evaluated from that resolved local node working directory.

The local-shell bootstrap fields `shell_login`, `shell_interactive`, and `shell_init` require `target.shell`. AgentFlow now rejects configs that set those fields without an explicit shell, because they would otherwise be silently ignored.

For common shell helper workflows, you can keep the config declarative instead of hand-writing a quoted shell template:

```yaml
target:
  kind: local
  shell: bash
  shell_login: true
  shell_interactive: true
  shell_init: kimi
```

This runs the node inside `bash`, explicitly enables login and interactive startup files, executes `kimi`, and then launches the prepared agent command. It is useful for helper functions defined in `~/.bashrc`. If you prefer to spell the wrapper directly, explicit shells such as `bash -lic` behave the same way, and AgentFlow suppresses Bash's harmless no-job-control stderr noise for those interactive wrappers too. If your login shell uses `~/.bash_profile`, make sure it eventually reaches `~/.bashrc`, either directly or via another startup file such as `~/.profile`; otherwise Bash only reads `~/.profile` when no `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bash_login` file is present. A minimal bridge looks like:

```bash
# ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile
if [ -f "$HOME"/.bashrc ]; then
  . "$HOME"/.bashrc
fi
```

When you bootstrap `kimi` through Bash, keep Bash interactive too. `agentflow inspect` and the `run`/`smoke` auto-preflight now warn when either `shell_init: kimi` or an explicit `target.shell` wrapper such as `bash -lc 'kimi && {command}'` is paired with non-interactive Bash, because helpers defined in `~/.bashrc` are commonly skipped in `bash -lc`-style setups.

`agentflow doctor` now also calls out the easy-to-miss case where `~/.bash_profile` exists, does not source `~/.bashrc`, and silently prevents a working `~/.profile` -> `~/.bashrc` bridge from ever running. When Bash falls back to `~/.profile` because `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.bash_login` are absent, the doctor output now says so directly. It also recognizes bridges written as absolute home paths such as `source /home/alice/.bashrc`. When bash startup checks fail in less predictable ways, the doctor output now strips Bash's harmless interactive-shell noise and redacts likely secret values before echoing shell diagnostics back to you. If you want the exact bridge to paste into the active login file, run `agentflow doctor --output summary --shell-bridge`.

`shell_init` is treated as a bootstrap prerequisite: if it exits non-zero, AgentFlow does not launch the wrapped agent command. This helps smoke runs fail fast when helper functions such as `kimi` are missing.

### Container

Wraps the command in `docker run`, mounts the working directory, runtime directory, and the AgentFlow app, then streams stdout and stderr back into the run trace.

### AWS Lambda

Invokes `agentflow.remote.lambda_handler.handler`. The payload contains the prepared command, environment, runtime files, and execution metadata so the Lambda package can execute the node remotely.

## Agent notes

### Codex

- Uses `codex exec --json`
- Maps tools mode to Codex sandboxing
- Writes `CODEX_HOME/config.toml` per node for provider and MCP selection

### Claude

- Uses `claude -p ... --output-format stream-json --verbose`
- Passes `--tools` according to the read-only vs read-write policy
- Writes a per-node MCP JSON config and passes it with `--mcp-config`

### Kimi

- Uses the active Python interpreter via `sys.executable -m agentflow.remote.kimi_bridge`
- Emits a Kimi-style JSON-RPC event stream
- Calls Moonshot's OpenAI-compatible chat completions API
- Provides a small built-in tool layer for read, search, write, and shell actions

## Web console

The frontend shows:

- current DAG state and node statuses
- live run timeline and parsed JSONL trace events
- per-node attempts and retry history
- final outputs plus launch, stdout, stderr, trace, and result artifacts
- controls to validate, launch, cancel, and rerun pipelines

Artifact files are persisted under `AGENTFLOW_RUNS_DIR/<run_id>/artifacts/<node_id>/`.
Each node now includes a redacted `launch.json` artifact that records the resolved command, working directory, selected runtime files, and any remote-runner payload metadata without storing secret env values or runtime file contents.

## API surface

The FastAPI app exposes:

- `POST /api/runs/validate`
- `POST /api/runs`
- `GET /api/runs`
- `GET /api/runs/{run_id}`
- `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/events`
- `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/stream`
- `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/artifacts/{node_id}/{name}`
- `POST /api/runs/{run_id}/cancel`
- `POST /api/runs/{run_id}/rerun`
- `GET /api/health`

## Testing

Run the Python suite:

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
pytest -q
```

Run the browser suite:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright test
```

The Playwright tests use lightweight mock `codex` and `claude` executables under `tests/e2e/bin/` and exercise validation, retries, rerun, cancellation, and artifact viewing through the web UI.

Run a real local smoke check with your installed CLIs:

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
agentflow smoke
```

This keeps the check small while exercising both local `codex` and local `claude` end-to-end. Before the bundled smoke pipeline starts, AgentFlow runs a local preflight that verifies `codex`, confirms that `bash -lic` can find the `kimi` shell helper and still launch both `claude` and `codex` afterwards, checks that `kimi` exports `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude-on-Kimi, and reports which bash login startup file is active, including transitive bridges such as `~/.bash_profile` -> `~/.profile` -> `~/.bashrc`. The preflight also warns when a login startup file references `~/.bashrc` but that file is missing, or when no bash login startup file exists to bridge into `~/.bashrc` at all. If `claude` only becomes available inside that login shell bootstrap, the preflight reports a warning instead of blocking the bundled smoke run. The same warning path now applies when `codex` only becomes available after the shared `kimi` bootstrap, as long as the bundled smoke pipeline can still launch it.

When `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bash_login` shadows a working `~/.profile` bridge, the preflight now tells you that the alternate startup path will never run, points you at the file that needs the bridge, and includes the bridge snippet inline when one is available.

You can run the same preflight directly:

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
agentflow doctor
```

The bundled smoke pipeline bootstraps the `kimi` shell helper inside the Claude node, so you do not need to wrap the entire `agentflow smoke` command in `bash -lic`. If you want to run a custom smoke pipeline instead, pass its path explicitly with `agentflow smoke path/to/pipeline.yaml`, or run it directly with `agentflow run path/to/pipeline.yaml` and keep the same `auto` preflight behavior for bundled and Kimi-bootstrapped local smoke pipelines. Use `--preflight always` for other custom pipelines that still need those checks, or `--preflight never` to skip preflight even for the bundled example. Add `--output json-summary` when you want a concise machine-readable result, or `--output json` when you want the full persisted run record instead of the compact summary.
